## Basic usage

You'll need a .csv file containing program participant data, including at least columns "lon" and "lat", containing WG84 (Mercator) location coordinates.

Example:

Having a "participants" dataframe such as

```{r}
participants <- read.csv("../data/participants.csv")

head(participants)
```

And another dataframe containing the Program sites, such as:

```{r}
locations <- read.csv("../data/locations.csv")

head(locations)
```

Then the geographic position of participants and program locations can be plotted, on top of a basemap, with:

```{r}
library(GPE)

GPE_plot_map(participants, locations)
```
